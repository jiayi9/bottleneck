# Chaku chaku line bottleneck analysis
Disclaimer: Only script is in this repository. No data is availble.

Background: It's typically impossible to identify performance bottleneck (output-related) in a running chaku chaku line because of the prevalent and always existing up/-downstream influences.

In this analysis, two creative times are computed for the station-specific performance assessment, and hence the bottleneck identitfication.
